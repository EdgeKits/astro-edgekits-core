This example shows how **interpolation, plural rules, and runtime formatting** work inside MDX when using EdgeKits Core’s Zero-JS i18n architecture.

While the previous demo focused on interactive components, this one demonstrates how **dynamic text** can come directly from Cloudflare KV — even when numbers or UI state change.

## A dynamic counter with localized text

Below is a React Island that exposes a simple counter.
The component itself contains **no English strings**. All labels come from KV:

- singular and plural forms (`1 item` → `5 items`)
- interpolated values (`{count}`)
- localized phrasing based on the active locale

Try switching between English and German to see how pluralization changes automatically.

<LocalizedCounter />

## Why this matters

Traditional client-side i18n requires:

- shipping JSON dictionaries to the browser,
- bundling a formatting engine,
- manually wiring pluralization rules,
- updating locale state inside React.

With EdgeKits Core:

1. Astro loads the correct translations at the edge.
2. Plural and interpolation logic runs **server-side**, before hydration.
3. React Islands receive **preformatted**, **type-safe** text.
4. No client-side i18n library is needed — **0 KB shipped**.

## Real-world use cases

This pattern works especially well for:

- price/quantity UI widgets,
- dashboards that require localized labels,
- MDX documentation with embedded interactive demos,
- forms with dynamic validation messages,
- any component where the text depends on numbers or state.

Because translations are stored in KV, content writers can manage phrasing without touching component code — even for complex cases involving plural logic or numeric formatting.
