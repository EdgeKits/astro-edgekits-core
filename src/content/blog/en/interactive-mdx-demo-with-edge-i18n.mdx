This is a standard paragraph in Markdown. The text you are reading now lives in the filesystem.

But what if we want to add a dynamic component, like a newsletter signup form? Usually, you'd have to hardcode the button labels inside the React component.

## The "Hybrid" Component

Below is a React Island. Its structure is defined in code, but **the text labels come from Cloudflare KV**. Try switching the language to German, and watch the component update automatically without changing the code!

<Newsletter />

## How it works

1. The page loads and fetches translations for the `blog` namespace from KV.
2. Astro passes these translations to the `<Newsletter />` component via props.
3. The component hydrates on the client (`client:visible`) using the correct language.

This allows content creators to use complex UI widgets without worrying about localization files.
